    			<h2>About Me</h2>
    			<div class="half-width">
    				<P>I fell in love with <span>HTML code</span> during my 11-year tenure as a communications specialist for American Express. I designed and built several user-friendly websites that captured the attention of employees. I managed the content of the pages through daily updates and conducted user experience testing twice a year to keep the pages enticing to the employees. Each of the websites I created consistently ranked in the top five percent of the most visited American Express sites.</P>

    				<p>In 2017, I returned to school to expand on my web designer and development skills to learn <span>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery</span> and <span>React</span> along with <span>Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator</span>. That's what I love about the tech world - there's always new skills to learn!</p>

    				<h3>Creative Web Design</h3>
    				<p>I tell your story by designing a website that impacts your target audience. I create a Photoshop wireframe so you see a full-color version of the site before I build it.</p>

    				<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
    				<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure its content is easy to read, easy to collaborate on, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

    				<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
    				<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
